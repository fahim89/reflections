Reflections 2 - Fahim Kadhi
Lesson 1 - Udacity - How to Use Git and Github

This is the first lesson I've finished in Udacity.
I'm loving the positive reinforcement I'm getting from immediately
implementing what I've learned. The instructor asked me to keep
the characters on each line short so that when I'm doing 
a diff comparison, the program will be able to pinpoint exactly
where the differences/error are.

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a Git repository there is a .git file created within
the folder. You need to do it to keep track of all the changes to your 
code. And Git is a great way to do that.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area allows you to select which files to add to your new
repository, considering that you probably don't want to all the files in
the working directory to the repository. Remember that it's better to
keep each commit small and not to have too many changes per each commit.
